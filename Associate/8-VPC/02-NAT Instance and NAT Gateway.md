## NAT Instance and NAT Gateway

![NAT](images/02-NAT.png)

NAT Instances 
- When creating a NAT instance, Disable Source/Destination Check on the Instance.
- NAT instances must be in a public subnet.
- There must be a route out of the private subnet to the NAT instance, in order for this to work.
- The amount of traffic that NAT instances can support depends on the instance size. If you are bottlenecking, increase the instance size.
- You can create high availability using Autoscaling Groups, multiple subnets in different AZs, and a script to automate failover.
- Behind a Security Group.

NAT Gateways
- Redundant inside the Availability Zone
- Preferred by the enterprise
- Starts at 5Gbps and scales currently to 45Gbps
- No need to patch
- Not associated with security groups
- Automatically assigned a public ip address
- Remember to update your route tables.
- No need to disable Source/Destination Checks
- If you have resources in multiple Availability Zones and they share one NAT gateway, in the event that the NAT gatewayâ€™s Availability Zone is down, resources in the other Availability Zones lose internet access. To create an Availability Zone-independent architecture, create a NAT gateway in each Availability Zone and configure your routing to ensure that resources use the NAT gateway in the same Availability Zone.
