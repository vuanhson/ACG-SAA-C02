## CloudFront Signed URLs and Cookies

### Restricting Content Access
Premium streaming services like netflix, online learning course etc...

### Use CloudFront Signed URLS or Signed Cookies
- A signed URL is for individual files, 1 file = 1 URL.
- A signed cookie is for multiple files, 1 cookie = multiple files.

### Signed URL Policies
When we create a signed URL or signed cookie, we attach a policy. The policy can include:
- URL expiration
- IP ranges
- Trusted signers (which AWS accounts can create signed URLS)
