## S3 Transfer Acceleration

S3 Transfer Acceleration utilises the CloudFront Edge Network to accelerate your uploads to S3. Instead of uploading directly to your S3 bucket, you can use a distinct URL to upload directly to an edge location which will then transfer that file to S3. You will get a distinct URL to upload to: acloudguru.s3-accelerate.amazonaws.com
