## Elastic Beanstalk & Cloud Formation

### Cloud Formation
- Is a way of completely scripting your cloud environment
- Quick Start is a bunch of CloudFormation templates already built by AWS Solutions Architects allowing you to create complex environments very quickly.

### Elastic Beanstalk
With Elastic Beanstalk, you can quickly deploy and manage applications in the AWS Cloud without worrying about the infrastructure that runs those applications. You simply upload your application, and Elastic Beanstalk automatically handles the details of capacity provisioning, load balancing, scaling, and application health monitoring.
